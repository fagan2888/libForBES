 * 
 * 
 * This class computes internally a Cholesky factorization of a given
 * symmetric positive definite matrix \f$A\f$ which can then be used to solve linear
 * systems. 
 * 
 * Here is an example of use:
 * 
 * \code{.cpp}
 *  size_t n = 20;
 * 
 *  Matrix A = MatrixFactory::MakeRandomMatrix(n, n, 0.0, 0.1, Matrix::MATRIX_SYMMETRIC);
 *  Matrix Y = MatrixFactory::MakeIdentity(n, 1.0);
 *  A += Y;
 * 
 *  Matrix ID(n, n, Matrix::MATRIX_DIAGONAL);
 *  for (size_t j = 0; j < n; ++j) {
 *       ID.set(j, j, 1 / A.get(j, j));
 *  }
 *  MatrixOperator Aop(A);
 *  MatrixOperator M(ID);
 *
 *  size_t max_iter = n;
 *  FactoredSolver * cholesky = new CholeskyFactorization(A);
 *  cholesky->factorize();
 *   
 *  Matrix b = MatrixFactory::MakeRandomMatrix(n, 1, 0.0, 5.0);
 *  Matrix sol(n,1);
 *  int status = cholesky->solve(b, sol);
 *   
 *  std::cout << status << std::endl;    
 *  double error = (A*sol-b).norm_fro();
 *  std::cout << error;
 *   
 *  delete cholesky;
 * \endcode
