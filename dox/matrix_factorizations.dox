 * \brief %Matrix factorizations and solvers
 * 
 * A matrix factorization is, in general, the procedure of decomposing a given 
 * matrix into a sum or product or other combination of two or more matrices which
 * possess favourable properties which can be exploited for instance to solve a 
 * linear system.
 * 
 * The ForBES API offers a simple interface to factor-solve procedures exporting 
 * to the client only what is necessary: a factor and a solve step. 
 * 
 * This is done by the abstract methods \c factorize() and \c solve() in FactoredSolver
 * which are implemented by derived classes.
 * 
 * \code
 * Matrix Q = ...;                      // A symmetric positive definite matrix
 * FactoredSolver * solver = new ...;   // Some factored solver
 * solver->factorize();                 // Factorize once
 * solver->solve(b, x);                 // Solve the system A*x = b
 * solver->solve(c, x);                 // Solve A*x = c
 * delete solver;                       // Release resources
 * \endcode

 *
 * Note that a FactoredSolver, is a class derived from the abstract class
 * MatrixSolver which is an abstraction layer for solvers of linear systems
 * given in the form \f$Ax=b\f$, where \f$A\f$ is a matrix.
 *
 * A more general case is addressed by LinSysSolver which is a generic and abstract
 * solver for linear systems given either in the above form or in the form 
 * \f$T(x)=b\f$, where \f$T\f$ is a linear operator (instance of LinearOperator).
 *
 * \section Cholesky
 * The Cholesky factorization can be applied to any symmetric positive definite
 * matrix. 
 * 
 * A symmetric positive definite matrix \f$A\f$ can be written as \f$A=LL'\f$, where
 * \f$L\f$ is a lower-triangular matrix. 
 * 
 * Using this matrix one can solve linear systems of the form \f$Ax=b\f$ (for a given \f$b\f$)
 * at the cost of a forward and a backward substitution.
 * 
 * \section LDL-sec LDL factorization
 * The LDL factorization (often referred to as \f$LDL'\f$ can be applied to any
 * symmetric matrix. A given symmetric matrix \f$A\f$ is decomposed as \f$A=LDL'\f$
 * where \f$L\f$ is lower-triangular and \f$D\f$ is a diagonal matrix.
 * 
 * This is evidently similar to the Cholesky factorization described
 * above, but does not require that the factorized matrix be positive definite. 
 * LDL can be applied to any symmetric matrix.
